An interactive CYK parser written in Python.

A CYK parser only accepts grammars in the Chomsky Normal Form (CNF).

An example for a CNF grammar:

Terminals:      a,b,...,z,+
Nonterminals:   E,Y+,S+
Rules:			
			E->a
			E->b
			...
			E->z
			E->E Y+
			Y+->S+ E
			S+->+
Starting symbol:E

This grammar creates the language of arithmetic expressions composed of sums of variables.
For example: "a","b","a+b","x+y+z" are part of the language, while "++a" or "ab" aren't.
